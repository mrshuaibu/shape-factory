## Overview

The Shape Factory is a web application that allows users to create and display colored shapes within a grid-based container. Users can choose the shape type and color, and add up to 20 shapes in the container. Each shape displays additional information upon clicking, including its order and color, and a message prevents further creation after reaching the limit.

## Features

- Choose between two shape types: Circle and Square.
- Select shape color from a color dropdown.
- Adds up to a maximum of 20 shapes within the container in a grid layout.
- Disables further shape creation with a "Max Shapes Reached" message once the limit is reached.
